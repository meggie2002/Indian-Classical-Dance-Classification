# Indian-Classical-Dance-Classification

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning model to classify images of eight Indian classical dance forms. It uses TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a multi-class image classification model.

## Features

*   Data preprocessing and augmentation
*   Implementation of custom CNN, VGG16, and InceptionV3 models
*   Model training and evaluation
*   Performance comparison of different architectures

## Technologies Used

*   Python
*   TensorFlow
*   Keras
*   Scikit-learn
*   Matplotlib
*   Pandas


## Results

| Model       | Test Accuracy |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| CNN         | 51.6%         |
| VGG16       | 54.9%         |
| InceptionV3 | 64.7%         |

## Conclusion

The InceptionV3 model achieved the highest accuracy in classifying Indian classical dance forms. Further improvements can be made by expanding the dataset and exploring more advanced architectures.
